 -> limit self requests based on server tolerance and individual usage
 -> illegitimate requests = blocked

- web admin panel
 - > with tools like map creator
- buildings for resource generation
- pvp, pve, solo duo - each give different resources
 -> can be exchanged on the market
- store: only a message: fuck mobile pay2win!
