AI
- consider CP to multi-planet-attack

- request responsiblity logic on client
 -> limit self requests based on server tolerance and individual usage
 -> illegitimate requests = blocked
 -> repeated illegitimate requests = ip+mac ban
- web admin panel
 - > with tools like map creator
- buildings for resource generation
- pvp, pve, solo duo - each give different resources
 -> can be exchanged on the market
- store: only a message: fuck mobile pay2win!

- pvp only at certain complexity
- coop gives bonus resources
