- Technology module to unlock abilities and stuff like range and defensebar

- abilities 
 -> techtree advances with ability usage exp gain
   -> usage depends on ability effect e.g. damage dealt / units slowed etc.
- ability module after rankunlocked needs to be unlocked 
  -> with total ap collected and equilibrium
  -> to build ai chip that enables a brainwave interface for equilibrium modulation
  -> enable new abilities and upgrade them with use
    -> training ai chip
- equilibrium
 -> matter, which can be molecularly arranged at will through energy
 -> stat for total ap collected
- ships balanced, buildings mostly resources, abilities mostly cp

- Shipyard
 -> higher classes
  -> cruiser, destroyer, titan
 -> blueprints can be bought in shop at will, no rng
 
- Workshop
 -> ship modulation

- Construction expansion
 -> buildings
 -> planet defense modulation
 
- factions
 -> swapable any time
 -> grants bonus based on loyalty
 -> malus for changing, but still worth it long term
 -> mostly affects economy and CP and ship/build/ability slots
 
- market 
 -> open to trade resources
 
- casino with slight win for generating stuff
