- test and live environment
- build apk

- build all as binary 
  CHECKLIST
  o discovery
  o auth
  o meta
  o commander
  o construction
  o shipyard
  o shop
  o starmap
  x game
  o matchmaking
  o control

---------------------------------------------------------------------
FUTURE RELEASES TODO:
- maybe different music for different menus with transition? combat,casino etc.

- ingame different edge border color for interaction mode active

- maybe add 0.99$ purchase to unlock adhd-friendly-mode (meant to be stupid)
 -> everything is animated rainbow colors
 -> there is a temple run vod that bounces across screen like dvd logo
 -> stupid sound effects

- make solo conquest offline (with online verification)

- scrollable console log

REFACTIORING:
- port all shaping over to EQShapes
- externalize planet resource bar to circularloadingbar component

- add planets conquered ship core stat
- implement full game logs to control and remove from main log

- ai with different playstyles
access via 1 month membership (credits or rl money)
- market 
 -> open to trade resources
- casino with free daily tokens for generating stuff by playing

- after all components are max level
 -> reset levels for permanent stat boost
- externalize ai/neutral stat load and calc to control
- custom desktop window frame
- make ai send ship from ancient to defend it
- 1v multi ai conquest

- MAKE ALL P2W COMMUNITY BENEFIT
- e.g.: every time someone buys something, everyone gets 1 gem or something
 -> (permanent withdrawable community fund)
 
- planet resource upgrades part of construction
- stats in profile like gametime, furthest in each campaign

- Turrets/Construction (could be its own big update)
- shop
 -> turret blueprints
 
- ships can collect meteorites for resources

- duo, trio campaign via social group
- social module, squad and alliance with vault
- replace money label with other squad player names (if in group), but remove click-on

- settings (show grid, show fleet lines)
- account security
 -> optional email provision
 -> authkey regeneration via mail
 -> optional 2-factor with mail on new device

- support-class ships/buildings
- ai chips = cards like in idle obelisk
 -> but instead through booster packs
 -> SHIPS AS CARDS?

GENERAL:
- if payment: global bonus and perks (idle obelisk system)

- playtab overhaul
- building build time
- void run = coop dungeoncrawler
- ai behavior manager tool

GAME:
- sending multiple ships?
- improved ai

META:
- boss battles where 1 giant ship jumps from planet to planet

- Technology module to unlock abilities and stuff like range and defensebar

ability ideas
-> called flagship (appears visually on screen, origin of casts)
 -> use skilltree from eqidle with alternative paths based on use
  -> eg ion beam: boost friendly planet shield regen by 3x for 5 sec
  -> OR disable enemy planet shield regen for 3 seconds
- abilities 
 -> techtree advances with ability usage exp gain
   -> usage depends on ability effect e.g. damage dealt / units slowed etc.
- ability module after rankunlocked needs to be unlocked 
  -> with total ap collected and equilibrium
  -> to build ai chip that enables a brainwave interface for equilibrium modulation
  -> enable new abilities and upgrade them with use
    -> training ai chip
- equilibrium
 -> matter, which can be molecularly arranged at will through energy
 -> stat for total ap collected
- ships balanced, buildings mostly resources, abilities mostly cp

- Shipyard
 -> higher classes
  -> cruiser, destroyer, titan
 -> blueprints can be bought in shop at will, no rng
 
- Workshop
 -> ship modulation

- Construction expansion
 -> buildings
 -> planet defense modulation
 
- factions
 -> swapable any time
 -> grants bonus based on loyalty
 -> malus for changing, but still worth it long term
 -> mostly affects economy and CP and ship/build/ability slots

- Hawk
- Tovak
- Trannel

AI
- consider CP to multi-planet-attack

IDEAS
- equilibrium as resource
 -> when accumulated, can be spent on global goals
 -> global goals give unique rewards
 -> full coop?
- flux ability (transfer CP to ally)
- beautiful bar animation, because so many bars
- request responsiblity logic on client
 -> limit self requests based on server tolerance and individual usage
 -> illegitimate requests = blocked
 -> repeated illegitimate requests = ip+mac ban
- web admin panel
 - > with tools like map creator
- buildings for resource generation
- pvp, pve, solo duo - each give different resources
 -> can be exchanged on the market
- store: only a message: fuck mobile pay2win!
- Only pay for feature expansions and skins
- pvp only at certain complexity
- coop gives bonus resources

Voice mod steps (TRASH):
- duplicate into 2x
- both: filter EQ: VOICE
- both: reverb: VOICE
- 2nd: delay track by 30MS
