FUTURE RELEASES TODO:

GAME:

 -> or any other conquest mode
 -> proper exp and resource rewards

 -> like now with custom and pvp/ai
 -> available to beginners, especially vs AI
 -> pvp has clash royale like ladder for 1v1,2v2,3v3
 - each mode grants unique resources (pvp/ai , conquest)

- social features (friends teams messages etc.)

- Technology module to unlock abilities and stuff like range and defensebar

- abilities 
 -> need to be ressearched over time with techtree
 -> techtree advances with ability usage exp gain

- casino with slight win for generating stuff
